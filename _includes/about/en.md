Hi, I am _@huxpro_ (Huang, Xuan), an UI/Frontend engineer & designer, accidentally growing into a compiler hacker. My current interests range from programming languages theory and implementation in general (compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection) to software engineering in the tech industry (client-side web/mobile app development, server-side backend, user interface and UX, developer infrastructure and DX).

Hi, I am SunQH (Sun Qinghu), a postgraduate student in Xidian University  and a DL, ML learner, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My interests range from programming to fitting. 

I will keep working hard.

##### [My PL Spectrum (WIP üöß)](https://huangxuan.me/2020/05/05/pl-chart/)

I made a chart to visualize my experiences and interests on some of the programming languages. I know. I know this is always contraversial. But it's just something quite self-entertaining to do. So bare with me and have fun reading that!

> __Left-right__ is how much I prefer it.  __Top-down__ is how much I know it. __Versions__ are lower bounds.
